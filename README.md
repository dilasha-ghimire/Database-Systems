## Introduction

In the database systems module, I actively engaged in various tasks, utilizing my expertise in SQL queries and MySQL. I delved into the nuances of database management, effectively navigating and manipulating data. Alongside these activities, I incorporated IPython Notebooks (ipynb) for diverse tasks in the broader database environment.

Beyond routine operations, my role in the module included optimizing SQL queries for efficient data retrieval and manipulation. With hands-on experience in MySQL, I refined my skills in designing and managing databases, addressing real-world scenarios and challenges.

A notable aspect of my participation involved leveraging IPython Notebooks. These interactive platforms seamlessly integrated into my workflow, enabling experimentation, analysis, and documentation of database-related tasks. Within the ipynb format, I combined code snippets, visualizations, and explanatory text, showcasing a holistic approach to database management.

Upon completing the module, I submitted two coursework files, reflecting not only my technical proficiency but also my problem-solving abilities and strategic thinking in the realm of database systems.
